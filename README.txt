* Who was involved in the project
Ben Kaufmann

∗ What the app is supposed to do
Take an series of inputs from the user to form a question, then submit the question to the OpenAI API, and return a response back to the user.

∗ Any applicable dependencies (e.g. a server, running on a phone)
Running on an android emulator or device.

∗ Any setup work I have to do (e.g. getting API keys or standing up a server)
No

∗ How to build / deploy your app for testing, if anything special is require
Building should be standard. It should be noted that I am not using the best model OpenAI offers because it is far cheaper than the better models, so the responses may seem a bit off at times.
